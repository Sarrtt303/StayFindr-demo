# StayFinder Development Roadmap & Complete Guide
🎯 Project Overview
StayFinder is a full-stack property rental platform similar to Airbnb, focusing on both short-term and long-term stays.

# 🛠️  Tech Stack
## Frontend:

React 18 with JavaScript
Tailwind CSS for styling
React Router for navigation
Axios for API calls
React Hook Form for form handling
React Query for data fetching
Lucide React for icons
Backend:
Node.js with Express.js
TypeScript for type safety
MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
JWT for authentication
bcryptjs for password hashing
multer for file uploads
cors for cross-origin requesjs
Additional Tools
Cloudinary for image storage
Nodemailer for emails
Express-validator for input validation

## Why this stack?
JavaScript/TypeScript across the stack for consistency
React's component-based architecture is perfect for reusable UI elemenjs
MongoDB's flexibility is ideal for varying property data structures
Express.js provides rapid API development

# Functionality gaps:
Focused on Core features and General resposiveness.
The location details cant be too specfic and be within the scope of react leaflet
Some pages that wont have valid coordinates which will then need manual input
No payment flow established or status change functionality 
No functionality for adding favourites
Show more detailed messages for login and register validation errors
Adding a protected route that wont allow normal users to create listing
Profile section with information of the user
Update requests and logic not added for listings



# Future work that can be done:
use the geo encode function in Lisitngs.jsx to generate the lats and longs based on the location provided by ther host. ✅
Fixing the Map to the start of the page for better UI/UX



# 🗃️ Database Schema Design
## Users Collection

{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: String (unique, required),
  password: String (hashed, required),
  firstName: String (required),
  lastName: String (required),
  phone: String,
  avatar: String (URL),
  isHost: Boolean (default: false),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
## Listings Collection

{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String (required),
  description: String (required),
  host: ObjectId (ref: User, required),
  location: {
    address: String (required),
    city: String (required),
    state: String (required),
    country: String (required),
    coordinates: {
      lat: Number,
      lng: Number
    }
  },
  price: Number (required),
  images: [String] (URLs),
  amenities: [String],
  propertyType: String (enum: ['apartment', 'house', 'condo', 'villa']),
  bedrooms: Number,
  bathrooms: Number,
  maxGuesjs: Number (required),
  availableFrom: Date,
  availableTo: Date,
  isActive: Boolean (default: true),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
## Bookings Collection
javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  listing: ObjectId (ref: Listing, required),
  guest: ObjectId (ref: User, required),
  checkIn: Date (required),
  checkOut: Date (required),
  guesjs: Number (required),
  totalPrice: Number (required),
  status: String (enum: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled'], default: 'pending'),
  paymentstatus: String (enum: ['pending', 'paid', 'refunded'], default: 'pending'),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
## Brief exaplanation of booking fields:
listing → the ID of the listing being booked (ref: Listing)

guest → the ID of the user making the booking (ref: User)

checkIn & checkOut → ISO 8601 date strings (you can use any future date)

guests → number of guests in the booking

totalPrice → total amount calculated (e.g., pricePerNight * nights)
